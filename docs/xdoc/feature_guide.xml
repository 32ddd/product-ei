<h1>WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (EI) - Feature Guide</h1>
    <p>WSO2 Carbon is an OSGi-based component framework allows the complete set of products to leverage
        shared components, ensuring a consistent set of features between products, a consistent user
        experience, and reusing of identical components.WSO2 Carbon provides the core capabilities
        for security, clustering, logging,statistics, and management, and through a technology
        called OSGi, higher level capabilities can be readily added as components to this core.
        WSO2 EI can be considered as WSO2 Carbon and bunch of features related to EI.
        With the power of componentized architecture of WSO2 Platform, user can add/remove various
        features from all WSO2 product.</p>


<h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>This documentation provides guideline on feature management related to WSO2 EI.</p>

<h2 id="OtherFeatures">Installing various features in WSO2 EI?</h2>

<p>Using the Feature Manager (Configure > Feature in the tabbed pane) you can install any feature
available in the feature repository(p2-repo). Please refer
<a href="http://wso2.org/project/carbon/3.2.0/docs/component-mgt/docs/userguide.html">Feature Manager Documentation.</a></p>

<h2 id="EIFeatureOnCarbonServer">Installing EI features on other WSO2 Products</h2>
    <p>
        Also there can be cases where we need to install the EI related features inside other WSO2 Products.
        For instance, we might have to install the EI Features on raw Carbon Server. For such cases, EI provides
        a single feature which install all the EI Related features. Using the Feature Manager
        (Configure > Feature in the tabbed pane) you can install 'EI Mediation' feature to get the functionality
        of EI in to any other WSO2 Product.

    </p>

    <p>In addition to that you have to modify some configuration files to get the complete functionality of the
        EI.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Replace $CARBON_HOME/repository/conf/axis2.xml with <a href="http://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/branches/carbon/3.2.0/products/EI/4.0.0/modules/distribution/product/src/main/conf/axis2.xml">axis2.xml file for EI.</a> </li>
        <li>Copy <a href="https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/branches/carbon/3.2.0/products/EI/4.0.0/modules/distribution/product/src/main/conf/synapse.properties">synapse.properties</a> to $CARBON_HOMElib/core/WEB-INF/classes/</li>
        <li>Replace $CARBON_HOME/lib/log4j.properties with EI <a href="https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/branches/carbon/3.2.0/products/EI/4.0.0/modules/distribution/product/src/main/conf/log4j.properties">log4j.properties.</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>After applying above changes, we have to restart the Carbon Server.</p>
